ocr-text-extraction
===================

I am not actively supporting this script. It was just an experiment.

Processes an image to extract the text portions. Primarily
used for pre-processing for performing OCR.

Implemented in Python using OpenCV.

Based on the paper "Font and Background Color Independent Text Binarization" by
T Kasar, J Kumar and A G Ramakrishnan
